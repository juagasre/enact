# Semantic Repository

The Semantic Repository enabler offers a “nexus” for data models, ontologies, and other files, that can be uploaded in different file formats, and served to users with relevant documentation. This enabler is aimed to support files that describe data models or support data transformations, such as ontologies, schema files, semantic alignment files etc. However, there are no restrictions on file format and size.
